for educational purposes and a proof-of-concept, an [osu!](http://osu.ppy.sh/) memory reader and playback application. mainly made to raise awareness of how easy it is to cheat in osu!

It records the location of the cursor during **any** replay (including auto) and plays them back, with the option of adding double time.
